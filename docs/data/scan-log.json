These catalogs are broken into instruments, beats, adjectives, prefixes and suffixes, regions, and genres. We also used Every Noise to inform our list of patterns which are used to combine the above fragments in unique ways.\nThe real fun of the Genrenator is the public API hosted on binaryjazz.us. If you're a developer (particularly one in need of a random genre or story about a genre), you can use the endpoint to fetch a random genre or genre story at https://binaryjazz.us/wp-json/",
